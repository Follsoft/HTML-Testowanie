# HTML-Testing

This repository is dedicated to testing my HTML programming skills.

What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Marked Language) is a programming language that is used to build web pages. It supports JavaScript, server actions (PHP, ASP) and allows you to design the website in terms of appearance (CSS).

I use knowledge based on tutorials from the W3Schools website (https://www.w3schools.com). There I use the newest add-on called Spaces, where you can experiment with your ideas for free.

Currently I only use HTML and CSS, soon I will be programming in JS, then I will buy a Raspberry PI and set up a server on it and experiment

* More coming soon *
